==============================

The View3D code as a whole should be considered to be licensed under the 
GNU General Public License (GPL). View3D in its original version was licensed 
in the public domain, however the code now incorporates GPL code from other
sources, and there have been new elements added.

In particular, the code for calculation of axisymmetric view factors is
taken from Elmer FEM. Code was written by Juha Katajamäki with modifications by
Dr Peter Råback. That code is licensed under the GPL license, see here:
http://www.csc.fi/english/pages/elmer/faq

Currently, that code isn't full integrated into View3D, we will be working 
on that over time.
