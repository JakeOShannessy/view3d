Abstract from the above report:

This report describes the use of adaptive integration for the calculation of 
view factors between simple convex polygons with obstructions. The accuracy of 
the view factor calculation is controlled by a convergence factor. The adaptive 
integration method is compared with two other common methods implemented in a 
modern computer program and found to have significant advantages in accuracy 
and even advantages in computational speed in some cases.
