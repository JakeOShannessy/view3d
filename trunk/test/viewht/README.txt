This test case was received from George Walton on 23 Oct 2008.
He warned that the data file format may not be current with latest versions of View3D.
However, my tests show that ViewHT gives me the same output as George sent me in output-expected.txt.

George emphasised that the view factors used in the input file here are 'grey view factors', that include 'the inter-reflections from gray surfaces' and that they can be computer by View3D.  I'm still working out exactly how these 'grey' view factors vary from the usual view factors as defined in the standard texts eg Holman, Incropera, or Lienhard.
