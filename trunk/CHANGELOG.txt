 - Cleanup of user's manual, added notes about new 3D viewer programs, etc.


Version 3.4
-----------
8 Mar 2008

 - This is the first release via SF.net, by John Pye. (JP)
 - Build scripts for SCons added.
 - The View2D code has been merged with the View3D code, although you must run
   different command-line programs
 - Ported to Linux
 - New OpenGL and Cairo based viewers added for basic checking of model
   geometry.
 - Added simple little program to convert view factors to the form of an ASCEND
   (http://ascend.cheme.cmu.edu) model, permitting solution of the radiation
   thermal equilibrium problem for small (~100 surface) problems based on view
   factors calculated with View3D or View2D.
