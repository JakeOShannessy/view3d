/**
	Calculate view factors for axisymmetric geometry.

	The function uses global variables to store the geometry, and so is not
	thread-safe.

	@param n number of surface elements
	@param surf[2*n] facets (a,b,..), stored as pairs like i1_a, i2_a, i1_b, i2_b,... where i1 and i2 are indices into the list of pairs 'crd'.
	@param crd[???] coordinates, as pairs like r0, z0, r1, z1, r2, z2,...

	The number of elements in the 'crd' array can possibly be determined by
	looking at the maximum index contained in the srf array...?

	Each facet is described by an index pair (i1,i2), which are indices into the
	crd array (the '0', '1' etc in the pairs example).

	TODO wouldn't it be easier to use some structs for this lot?

	@param *fast boolean int value (shouldn't be a pointer?), if non-zero, combine original boundary elements for shading calculation. if zero, don't combine.
	@param *idiv int value (shouldn't be a pointer?), looks like a number of subdivision of the specified surfaces, not sure what it's being used for yet.

	@param vf pointer to an array of size n^2, such that vf[i*n+j] is the view factor from surface i to surface j (TODO check i vs j direction)

	@return Returns the values vf by writing to the vf array.
