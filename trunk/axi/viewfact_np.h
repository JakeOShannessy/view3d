/**
	A refactored call to Juha Katajam√§ki's axisymmetric view factor calculation
	routine. This function is given parameters suitable for wrapping via SWIG
	using the 'numpy.i' conventions.

	@param surf Array of surface coordinate indices (nrows = nsurf, ncols = 2)
	@param nsurf Number of surfaces
	@param nvert Number of vertices per surface. Must be 2. numpy.i will want to give us this, even though its value can't be changed.
	@param coord Array of coordinates for vertices (nrows = npoint, ncols = 2)
	@param npoint Number of points specified in coord.
	@param ndim Number of dimensions in the specified points. Must be 2. numpy will want to give us this, even though its value must be 2.
	@param vf View factors, values modified in-place for return. Square array of size nsurf x nsurf (We will check nsurf1==nsurf and nsurf2==nsurf)
	@param idiv Number of divisions to make in shading calculations, TODO document this.
	@param fast Something about checking and merging, TODO document this.

	@return 0 on success, nonzero if there was an error in input dimensions
